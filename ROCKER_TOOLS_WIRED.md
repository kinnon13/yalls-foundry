# Rocker Tools Execution - WIRED ✅

## What Was Fixed

Rocker AI now **actually executes** his tools instead of just describing them. The system properly handles tool calls, executes the corresponding edge functions, and returns results back to the AI.

## Implemented Tool Execution

### Core Tools (All Functional)
1. **get_user_profile** - Fetches user profile from database
2. **search_user_memory** - Searches stored memories and preferences  
3. **write_memory** - Saves durable information (preferences, facts, goals)
4. **search_entities** - Finds horses, businesses, events, users
5. **save_post** - Bookmarks posts with optional notes
6. **reshare_post** - Shares posts with commentary
7. **recall_content** - Natural language search for saved content
8. **create_event** - Initiates event builder

## How It Works

### Backend (rocker-chat function)
```typescript
// Tool calling loop
1. Send messages to OpenAI with available tools
2. If AI requests tool calls:
   - Execute each tool via executeTool()
   - Call respective edge functions (save-post, rocker-memory, etc.)
   - Add results back to conversation
   - Continue loop until AI has final answer
3. Return final response
```

### Frontend (useRocker hook)
```typescript
// Changed from streaming to JSON response
- Send message to rocker-chat
- Receive complete response with tool execution results
- Display final answer
```

## Tool Execution Flow

```
User: "Save this post about barrel racing"
  ↓
Rocker decides to use save_post tool
  ↓
Backend calls supabase.functions.invoke('save-post', {...})
  ↓
Post saved, result returned to AI
  ↓
AI responds: "✅ Saved to your 'All' collection"
```

## Memory System Active

Rocker now remembers:
- **Preferences** (favorite event types, notification settings)
- **Facts** (horse names, barn locations, coach info)
- **Goals** (competition plans, training objectives)
- **Notes** (important reminders, past conversations)

Memory is automatically searched before responding and written when user shares durable information.

## What This Means

✅ Rocker can see your profile information  
✅ Rocker remembers your preferences across conversations  
✅ Rocker can actually save posts when you ask  
✅ Rocker can search for horses/events/users  
✅ Rocker can help create events with proper forms  
✅ Rocker can recall saved content using natural language  

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. Add UI feedback when tools execute (loading states, confirmations)
2. Wire upload_media to actual file upload flow
3. Add navigation when Rocker creates/finds entities
4. Show tool execution results in chat (e.g., "✅ Post saved")
