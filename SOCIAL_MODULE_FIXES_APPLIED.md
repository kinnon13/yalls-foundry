# Social Module Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

## Routes Consolidated (7-Route Spine Enforced)

### Deleted Routes:
- `/home` → Now `/` (duplicate removed)
- `/post-feed` → Now `/` (duplicate removed)
- `/signup` → Now `/login` (login page handles both login & signup via tabs)
- `/ai-management` → Now `/dashboard?tab=ai`
- `/profile` (without ID) → Redirects to user's own profile
- `/consent` → Consolidated into signup form (single master checkbox)
- `/calendar` → Now `/dashboard?tab=calendar` (personal) + feed section (public events)
- `/mlm/dashboard` → Now `/dashboard?tab=mlm` (private)
- `/mlm/tree` → Now `/dashboard?tab=mlm` (private)
- `/cart` → Now `/marketplace?view=cart`
- `/checkout` → Now `/marketplace?view=checkout`
- `/horses` → Now `/search?category=horses`
- `/horses/create` → Now `/dashboard?tab=profiles&action=create&type=horse`
- `/events` → Now `/search?category=events`
- `/events/create` → Now `/dashboard?tab=events&action=create`
- `/business/:bizId/*` → All moved to `/dashboard?tab=business&id=:bizId`
- `/posts/saved` → Now `/dashboard?tab=saved`

### Final Public Routes (7 Total):
1. `/` (feed)
2. `/search`
3. `/marketplace`
4. `/marketplace/:id`
5. `/profile/:id`
6. `/dashboard`
7. `/admin/control-room`

Plus single auth route: `/login` (handles both login & signup)

**Admin Note**: Admin is already consolidated — only `/admin/control-room` exists as the single admin surface.

## Feature Changes - ALL COMPLETE ✅

### ✅ Dashboard Tabs Created:
- **Calendar Tab** (`/dashboard?tab=calendar`): Personal calendar view with sidebar and event management
- **MLM Tab** (`/dashboard?tab=mlm`): Private MLM dashboard with referral link, stats, and commissions
- **Settings Tab** (`/dashboard?tab=settings`): Feed layout preferences moved here

### ✅ Feed Enhancements:
- **Upcoming Events Row**: Horizontal scrolling section showing public events
- **Rocker Labels Removed**: Debug toggle moved to admin-only panel

### ✅ Search Actions Added:
- **Claim Button**: Redirects to `/dashboard?tab=profiles&action=claim&id=X`
- **View Button**: Redirects to `/profile/[id]`
- **Add to Calendar**: Opens calendar modal for events
- **Users Tab**: Now searches profiles table

### ✅ Admin Control Room:
- **Rocker Labels Panel**: Toggle debug labels (admin-only)
- Integrated into Admin Rocker tab
- **Single Admin Surface**: Only `/admin/control-room` exists (already consolidated)

### ✅ Consent Simplified:
- **Master Checkbox**: Single consent checkbox in signup form
- **Covers All**: Terms, Privacy, SMS, Email, Push, AI features in one agreement
- **User-Friendly**: Reduces signup friction, settings changeable later in Settings → Privacy
- **No Separate Page**: `/consent` route removed, integrated into signup

## Feature Changes

### Removed from User UI:
- ✅ Rocker Labels toggle (debug feature) - now admin-only in control room
- ✅ Feed layout selector inline - now in `/dashboard?tab=settings`

### MLM Privacy Hardening:
- ✅ RLS policies created (pending table creation):
  - `own_rows_select` on `affiliate_subscriptions`
  - `own_rows_write` on `affiliate_subscriptions`
  - `own_commissions_select` on `mlm_commissions`
  - `own_payouts_select/update` on `mlm_payouts`
  - `own_tree_select` on `mlm_structure`
  - Admin full access with audit logs

### AI Integration:
- ✅ `ai_rank` feature flag added (default: off)
- ✅ Edge function: `ai-rank-search` (personalizes search results)
- ✅ Edge function: `ai-curate-feed` (personalizes feed ranking)
- Both degrade gracefully when flag off

### Navigation Helpers:
- ✅ Redirect rules created: `src/lib/navigation/redirects.ts`
- Maps legacy routes to new consolidated paths
- Preserves query params
