# Predictive Model Module

## Purpose
Predictive analytics for anticipating user needs, system issues, and optimization opportunities.

## Planned Features
- User intent prediction
- Proactive suggestion generation
- System failure prediction
- Resource demand forecasting
- Behavioral pattern modeling

## Future Implementation
This folder is a placeholder for predictive AI features that will enable:
- Anticipating what user will ask next
- Proactively suggesting relevant content
- Predicting system bottlenecks before they occur
- Forecasting token usage and costs
- Identifying trends in user behavior

## Integration
Will integrate with:
- User memory for behavioral history
- System metrics for pattern detection
- Planning modules for proactive actions
- Analytics for trend analysis

## Models
Future models may include:
- Time series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Neural networks for intent prediction
- Anomaly detection for failure prediction
- Reinforcement learning for optimization
