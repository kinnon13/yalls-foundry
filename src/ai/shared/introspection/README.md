# Introspection Module

## Purpose
Self-inspection and system analysis capabilities for AI to understand its own state and capabilities.

## Planned Features
- Capability inventory and cataloging
- Performance analysis per capability
- Resource consumption tracking
- Failure pattern detection
- Self-diagnosis and health checks

## Future Implementation
This folder is a placeholder for advanced introspection features that will enable AI to:
- Query its own capabilities dynamically
- Understand resource constraints
- Detect degraded performance
- Suggest self-improvements
- Generate capability reports

## Integration
Will integrate with:
- `meta_cortex/self_model.ts` for self-awareness
- `meta_cortex/capability_scanner.ts` for discovery
- `system_metrics` table for performance data
- `ai_brain_state` table for state tracking
