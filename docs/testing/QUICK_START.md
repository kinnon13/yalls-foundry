## Quick Smoke Commands

### Generate More Suggestions
```bash
curl -s "https://xuxfuonzsfvrirdwzddt.supabase.co/functions/v1/perceive_tick" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' | jq .
```

### Trigger Self-Improvement
```bash
curl -s "https://xuxfuonzsfvrirdwzddt.supabase.co/functions/v1/self_improve_tick" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' | jq .
```

### Test Model Router
```bash
curl -s "https://xuxfuonzsfvrirdwzddt.supabase.co/functions/v1/model_router" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tenantId":null,"taskClass":"mdr.generate","requiredTokens":4096}' | jq .
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "model": "grok-2",
  "maxTokens": 8192,
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "downgraded": false
}
```

## Emergency Rollback

If something goes wrong:

```sql
-- Kill switch
UPDATE ai_control_flags 
SET global_pause = true, write_freeze = true, external_calls_enabled = false;

-- Then investigate, fix, and re-enable:
UPDATE ai_control_flags 
SET global_pause = false, write_freeze = false, external_calls_enabled = true;
```

## Need Help?

Check the full test plan: `docs/testing/UI_TEST_PLAN.md`

Or run database verification:
```sql
select 
  'Suggestions' as item, count(*)::text as ready 
  from ai_proactive_suggestions where executed = false
union all
select 'Incidents', count(*)::text 
  from ai_incidents where resolved_at is null
union all
select 'Routes', count(*)::text 
  from ai_model_routes;
```

Expected: Suggestions=3, Incidents=1, Routes=3
