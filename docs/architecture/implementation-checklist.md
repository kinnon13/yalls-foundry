# Implementation Checklist: Canonical Area Discovery

**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Status**: ‚úÖ READY TO DEPLOY

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Items

### 1. Route Registry Updates
- ‚úÖ Added `/equistats` to `COLLAPSE_HEADS` in `feature-scan-filters.ts`
- ‚úÖ Added `/equistats` to `ROUTE_CATEGORIES` as 'public'
- ‚úÖ `/organizer` already in `COLLAPSE_HEADS` and `ROUTE_CATEGORIES`

### 2. Missing RPCs Created
All three missing RPCs have been created via database migration:

- ‚úÖ **`get_user_workspaces()`** - Returns list of personal + owned + member workspaces
  - Returns: `entity_id`, `entity_type`, `display_name`, `handle`, `role`, `is_owner`
  - Security: `SECURITY DEFINER`
  - Access: Authenticated users see their accessible workspaces

- ‚úÖ **`get_workspace_summary(entity_id)`** - Returns KPI dashboard data
  - Returns: JSONB with counts for listings, orders, events, entries, unread messages
  - Security: `SECURITY DEFINER` with access checks
  - Access: Owner or member of entity workspace

- ‚úÖ **`attach_incentive_to_event(entity_id, incentive_id, event_id)`** - Links incentive to event
  - Returns: JSONB with success status
  - Security: `SECURITY DEFINER` with dual authorization check
  - Access: Either incentive owner OR event organizer can attach
  - Logs: Action logged to `ai_action_ledger`

### 3. Feed Tables Verification
- ‚úÖ `posts` table exists with RLS enabled
- ‚úÖ `post_targets` table exists with RLS enabled
- ‚úÖ `post_drafts`, `post_reshares`, `post_saves`, `post_tags` all exist with RLS
- ‚úÖ `feed_hides` table exists with RLS enabled

### 4. Security-Definer Check
All entity claim RPCs are properly secured:
- ‚úÖ `entity_claim_approve()` - SECURITY DEFINER ‚úì
- ‚úÖ `entity_claim_reject()` - SECURITY DEFINER ‚úì
- ‚úÖ `entity_claim_start()` - SECURITY DEFINER ‚úì

### 5. PII Labeling
Already present in the export JSON at `generated/feature-mapping-export.json`:
- ‚úÖ All tables have `pii: true|false` field
- ‚úÖ PII tables identified: profiles, orders, payments, notifications, messages, crm_contacts, etc.

### 6. Canonical Area Discovery Config
- ‚úÖ Saved to `docs/architecture/canonical-area-discovery.json`
- ‚úÖ Ready to integrate with scanner/feature system

## üìã Policy Decisions: CONFIRMED

### Decision 1: Organizer Nesting
**‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Keep `/organizer/*` as top-level route**

**Rationale:**
- Simpler mental model for organizers
- Clear separation of concerns (organizer tools vs. workspace modules)
- Allows dedicated organizer navigation without workspace context switching
- `/organizer/*` routes can still reference workspace context internally

**Implementation:**
- `/organizer/events` - List of events you organize
- `/organizer/events/:id/manage` - Event management dashboard
- `/organizer/events/:id/check-in` - QR check-in flow
- No aliasing needed; remains top-level family

---

### Decision 2: EquiStats Visibility
**‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Dual visibility (public + workspace)**

**Public Routes** (no auth required):
- `/equistats/horse/:id` - Public horse performance page
- `/equistats/compare` - Compare multiple horses
- `/equistats/pedigree/:id` - Public pedigree tree
- `/equistats/crosses/:sireId/:damId` - Cross analysis
- `/equistats/insights` - Public market insights

**Workspace Routes** (auth + entity access):
- `/workspace/:entityId/equistats` - Entity-specific earnings dashboard
- Shows earnings, incentive participation, programs for that entity's horses

**Link Strategy:**
- Public pages include "View in Workspace" CTA for owned entities
- Workspace pages link to public pages for sharing/promotion
- Workspace analytics show private data (unpublished earnings, pending nominations)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Public routes use `get_event_viewable()` pattern for data access
- Workspace routes check `entity_members` + `owner_user_id` via RLS
- Analytics aggregation respects privacy settings per entity

## üîß Integration Points

### Scanner Integration
The scanner should now:
1. ‚úÖ Recognize `/equistats/*` as a collapsed family
2. ‚úÖ Recognize `/organizer/*` as a collapsed family (already in place)
3. ‚úÖ Apply route aliases before classification
4. ‚úÖ Map routes to canonical areas using `canonical-area-discovery.json`

### Feature System Integration
When claiming features:
1. Use canonical area names from `canonical-area-discovery.json`
2. Map RPCs to areas using `rpcsByArea`
3. Map tables to areas using `tableClusters`
4. Badge PII tables in the UI using `piiLikely` list

### Dashboard Components
Next implementation steps:
1. Create workspace picker component (dropdown showing results from `get_user_workspaces()`)
2. Create workspace context provider (stores current `entityId`)
3. Build dashboard home using `get_workspace_summary()` for KPI tiles
4. Add incentive management UI with `attach_incentive_to_event()` integration

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. Wire workspace picker to `get_user_workspaces()` RPC
2. Build dashboard home tiles using `get_workspace_summary()` data
3. Update route registry to include all EquiStats routes
4. Add "View in Workspace" CTAs to public EquiStats pages

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. Implement incentive attachment UI using `attach_incentive_to_event()`
2. Build workspace context switching (preserves nav state)
3. Create EquiStats public landing page
4. Add workspace-specific analytics to EquiStats

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Full pedigree tree visualization
2. Cross analysis recommendations
3. Market insights dashboard
4. Workspace module feature flags

## üìù Notes

**Migration Status**: Database migration created and ready for approval. Once approved, all RPCs will be available in production.

**Breaking Changes**: None. All changes are additive (new RPCs, new route categories, new areas). Existing routes, RPCs, and tables remain unchanged.

**Backward Compatibility**: Full. All legacy routes are aliased to canonical paths, so existing links continue to work.

**Documentation**: Complete. All changes documented in:
- `docs/architecture/route-mapping-overview.md` (comprehensive)
- `docs/architecture/canonical-area-discovery.json` (machine-readable)
- `generated/feature-mapping-export.json` (scanner export)

---

**Sign-off**: Ready for production deployment pending database migration approval.
