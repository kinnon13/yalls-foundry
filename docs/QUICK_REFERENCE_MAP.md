## üí° GOLDEN RULES

1. **10 Canonical Routes** = Always direct routes (/, /discover, /dashboard, etc.)
2. **Rocker/Andy/Console** = Always direct routes (special workspaces)
3. **Admin Special Cases** = Direct routes (guardrails, approvals, etc.)
4. **Everything Else** = Overlay system (`?app=key`)
5. **Dashboard Features** = Tabs (`/dashboard?tab=x`)
6. **Entity/Event/Listing Details** = Direct routes with :id param
7. **Creation Flows** = Overlays or query params (`?action=create`)
8. **Admin Panels** = Components, not routes
9. **Duplicates** = Delete
10. **Orphans** = Delete or integrate
