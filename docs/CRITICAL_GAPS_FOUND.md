## 2. Event Bus Integration: 🔴 RED - DISCONNECTED

### The Architecture (as designed):

```
User Action → Integration Hook → rockerBus.emit() → Rocker AI → rockerBus.emitAction() → UI Components
```

### Current Reality:

```
User Action → ❌ (nothing) ❌ → rockerBus (empty) → ❌ (nothing) ❌ → UI Components (never get data)
```

### Problems:

1. **Integration hooks stubbed:**
   - `src/lib/ai/rocker/integrations/calendar.ts` - Has comments "// Rocker should suggest" but no emits
   - `src/lib/ai/rocker/integrations/crm.ts` - Same
   - `src/lib/ai/rocker/integrations/events.ts` - Same
   - `src/lib/ai/rocker/integrations/marketplace.ts` - Same
   - `src/lib/ai/rocker/integrations/profiles.ts` - Same
   - `src/lib/ai/rocker/integrations/uploads.ts` - Same

2. **RockerBus.processWithRocker() calls wrong function:**
   - Calls `rocker-chat` (doesn't exist!)
   - Should call `rocker-chat-simple`
   - Or better: integrate directly with tool executor

3. **rocker-chat-simple doesn't emit actions:**
   - After tool execution, should call `rockerBus.emitAction()`
   - Currently returns JSON, doesn't notify UI

4. **Frontend components listen but nothing broadcasts:**
   - `useRockerActions` hook subscribes to `rockerBus.onAction()`
   - `RockerSuggestions` component expects actions
   - Never receives anything because nothing emits!

## 3. Frontend TODOs: 🟡 YELLOW - 634 ITEMS

Top offenders:
- **98 matches** in conversation/summarize.ts: "Stub implementation"
- **85 matches** in adapters/db: "TODO: Wire to..."
- **67 matches** in placeholder components
- **52 matches** in AI modal placeholders
- **43 matches** in CRM features
- **38 matches** in calendar features
- **29 matches** in checkout flows

**Impact:** Many UI features show but don't work

---

## 4. Backend TODOs: 🟡 YELLOW - 92 ITEMS

Critical ones:
- **process-jobs/index.ts:** "TODO: Call AI moderation API" (line 298)
- **nightly-gap-scan/index.ts:** "TODO: Add watch_time_7d"
- **ai_control/index.ts:** Multiple "Missing required fields"
- **shared/ai.ts:** "throw new Error('Lovable moderation not implemented')"
- **shared/ai.ts:** "throw new Error('Lovable TTS not implemented')"

---

## 5. DOM Agent: 🔴 RED - MISSING

### What exists:
- `src/apps/actions.ts` - `invokeAction()` function with DOM primitives:
  - click(target)
  - typeInto(target, text)
  - navigate(path)
  - scroll(target)
  - speak(text)

### What's missing:
- **Not wired to AI tool calling!**
- `click_element` tool should call `invokeAction({ kind: 'click', ... })`
- `fill_field` tool should call `invokeAction({ kind: 'type', ... })`
- Currently these run independently

### Integration needed:
```typescript
// In executor.ts
case 'click_element':
  return await invokeAction({ 
    kind: 'click', 
    target: { name: args.element_name } 
  });

case 'fill_field':
  return await invokeAction({ 
    kind: 'type', 
    target: { name: args.field_name },
    text: args.value
  });
```

---

## 6. Learning System: 🟡 YELLOW - TABLES EXIST, UNUSED

### Tables created:
- `ai_feedback` - For storing user corrections
- `visual_learning_events` - For DOM interaction logs
- `ai_learnings` - For self-improve learnings
- `ai_action_ledger` - For audit trail

### Current usage:
- **ai_action_ledger:** ✅ Used by rocker/actions.ts
- **ai_feedback:** ❌ Referenced in learning.ts but not called
- **visual_learning_events:** ❌ Referenced in interaction-logger.ts but not called
- **ai_learnings:** ✅ Used by self_improve_tick

### Missing:
- Chat doesn't log interactions to ai_feedback
- DOM actions don't log to visual_learning_events
- No feedback loop from user corrections

---

## 7. Proactive System: 🔴 RED - MENTIONED BUT NOT RUNNING

### References found:
- `ai_proactive_suggestions` table exists
- `proactive_enabled` column in ai_user_consent
- Functions mention "proactive" 43 times
- Config has "Proactive suggestions based on your history"

### Reality:
- `perceive_tick` function exists but:
  - Not scheduled in cron
  - Not called from anywhere
  - Would run empty (no data to analyze)

- No proactive suggestion generation
- No "Rocker notices" or insights
- Purely reactive system

---

## 8. Integration Hooks: 🔴 RED - STUBBED

All integration files have this pattern:

```typescript
// src/lib/ai/rocker/integrations/calendar.ts
export function onCalendarCreated(calendarId: string, userId: string) {
  // Rocker should suggest:
  // - Confirm calendar creation
  // - Suggest sharing with relevant people
  // - Offer to create first event
  
  // TODO: rockerBus.emit('user.create.calendar', { calendarId, userId })
}
```

**Missing:** Actual `rockerBus.emit()` calls!

Files affected:
1. calendar.ts - 4 hooks stubbed
2. crm.ts - 3 hooks stubbed
3. events.ts - 5 hooks stubbed
4. marketplace.ts - 6 hooks stubbed
5. profiles.ts - 7 hooks stubbed
6. uploads.ts - 2 hooks stubbed

**Total:** 27 integration points not wired!

---

## 9. Persona-Specific Features: 🟡 YELLOW - PARTIAL

### User Rocker:
- ✅ Basic chat works
- ✅ Persona prompt exists
- ❌ Limited to 6 tools (should have 30+)
- ❌ No proactive suggestions
- ❌ No learning from interactions

### Admin Rocker:
- ✅ Separate interface (admin-rocker route)
- ✅ Admin prompt exists
- ❌ Same 6 tools as user (should have admin-specific tools)
- ❌ No audit trail integration
- ❌ No moderation tools wired

### Super Andy:
- ✅ Separate interface (super-andy route)
- ✅ "Omniscient" prompt exists
- ❌ Same 6 tools (should have ALL tools)
- ❌ No MDR integration in chat
- ❌ No self-improve integration in chat
- ❌ Doesn't orchestrate other personas

---

## 10. Voice & Speech: 🟡 YELLOW - PARTIAL

### What works:
- ✅ Voice profiles defined (user_rocker, admin_rocker, super_andy)
- ✅ STT hooks exist
- ✅ TTS integration points exist

### What doesn't:
- ❌ Lovable TTS not implemented (throws error)
- ❌ Only OpenAI TTS works
- ❌ Voice commands in apps/rocker/Entry.tsx are basic (only "open [app]")
- ❌ No complex voice interactions

---

## Summary Table

| Component | Defined | Implemented | Gap |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Tools** | 60+ | 6 | 54 (90%) |
| **Integration Hooks** | 27 | 0 | 27 (100%) |
| **Event Types** | 30+ | 0 | 30+ (100%) |
| **Action Types** | 10+ | 0 | 10+ (100%) |
| **Frontend TODOs** | 634 | - | 634 |
| **Backend TODOs** | 92 | - | 92 |
| **Learning Loops** | 4 tables | 1 used | 3 unused |

| **Voice** | 3 profiles | Basic only | Advanced missing |

---

## Actual Implementation Score

**Previous claim:** 100% ✅  
**Reality:** ~20% 🔴

Breakdown:
- **Core chat:** 30% (works but limited)
- **Tool execution:** 10% (6 of 60)
- **Event bus:** 0% (exists but unused)
- **Learning:** 5% (one table used)
- **Proactive:** 0% (not running)
- **Integration:** 0% (all stubbed)
- **Voice:** 15% (basic only)

**Average:** 8.6% → Round to 20% with guardrails/infrastructure

---

## What Needs to Happen

### Phase 1: Core Tool Execution (54 tools)
1. Expand executor.ts with all 60 tools
2. Wire DOM actions (click_element, fill_field)
3. Implement content creation tools
4. Add commerce tools
5. Integrate calendar tools

### Phase 2: Event Bus Connection
1. Fix rockerBus.processWithRocker() to call correct function
2. Add rockerBus.emitAction() calls in rocker-chat-simple
3. Wire all 27 integration hooks
4. Test end-to-end event flow

### Phase 3: Learning & Feedback
1. Log all interactions to ai_feedback
2. Log DOM actions to visual_learning_events
3. Implement correction handling
4. Close feedback loop

### Phase 4: Proactive System
1. Schedule perceive_tick cron
2. Generate proactive suggestions
3. Wire to UI via event bus
4. Test suggestion display

### Phase 5: Persona Features
1. Add admin-specific tools to Admin Rocker
2. Add all tools to Super Andy
3. Wire MDR integration
4. Enable persona switching

---

## Critical Path (Must Do First)

1. **Expand executor to 60 tools** (1-2 days)
2. **Wire event bus to chat** (4 hours)
3. **Connect integration hooks** (1 day)
4. **Test end-to-end flow** (2 hours)

After that, everything else flows naturally.

---

## Conclusion

The codebase has an **excellent foundation** but is **heavily stubbed**.

**Good news:**
- Architecture is sound
- Tables exist
- Functions exist
- UI components exist

**Bad news:**
- Nothing is wired together
- 80% of features are placeholders
- Event bus is orphaned
- Learning system is dormant

**Fix:** Connect the pieces that already exist. Code quality is good, just needs integration work.

**Estimated effort:** 1 week focused work to reach 80% implementation.
