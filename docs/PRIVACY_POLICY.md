# Privacy Policy - AI Data Usage

## What We Collect

### Always Collected (Legal Compliance)
For safety, security, and legal compliance, we always collect:
- User identity (user ID, email)
- Full conversation history
- Actions performed through the platform
- Timestamps and session data

**Purpose:** Legal requests, fraud prevention, abuse detection, platform security

### Opt-In Collection (Personalization)
When you enable learning and personalization, we collect:
- User preferences and interests
- Behavioral patterns
- Usage analytics
- Interaction success rates

**Purpose:** Platform improvement, personalized recommendations, better user experience

## How Your Data is Used

### Confidentiality Guarantee
All learned patterns and preferences are:
- ✅ Stored confidentially
- ✅ Used ONLY for platform training and improvement
- ✅ Never shared with third parties
- ✅ Never sold or monetized

### Personal Information Protection
**CRITICAL: We do NOT use personal identifiers in AI training:**
- ❌ Names are not used in training data
- ❌ Email addresses are not used in training data
- ❌ Phone numbers are not used in training data
- ❌ Addresses are not used in training data

Instead, we use:
- ✅ Anonymous user IDs (UUIDs)
- ✅ Aggregated behavior patterns
- ✅ De-identified preference data
- ✅ Statistical patterns across users

### Platform Training Process
1. **Individual Learning:** Your preferences are stored with your anonymous user ID
2. **Pattern Aggregation:** When 5+ users show the same pattern, it becomes a "global pattern"
3. **Training Data:** Only aggregated, de-identified patterns are used for AI training
4. **No Personal Info:** Your name, email, and personal details never enter the training pipeline

**Example:**
- ❌ NOT USED: "John Smith (john@email.com) prefers morning notifications"
- ✅ USED: "User pattern: 67% of users prefer morning notifications"
