# Rocker OS 1.0 Implementation Status

## âœ… Completed (Day 1)

### Kernel Modules
- [x] **Types** (`src/kernel/types.ts`) - Core contracts, AppId, ActionId, EventId, contexts
- [x] **Command Bus** (`src/kernel/command-bus.ts`) - Central dispatch, validation, idempotency, ledger logging
- [x] **Contract Registry** (`src/kernel/contract-registry.ts`) - Store/retrieve contracts, search by intent/context
- [x] **Policy Guard** (`src/kernel/policy-guard.ts`) - Quiet hours, daily caps, ownership checks
- [x] **Context Manager** (`src/kernel/context-manager.ts`) - Active context (user/business/farm), stack, swipe
- [x] **Event Bus** (already exists) - `src/lib/rocker/event-bus.ts`

### Contracts
- [x] **CRM** (`src/apps/crm/contract.ts`) - Actions: create/update/delete contact, schedule followup, import
- [x] **Marketplace** (`src/apps/marketplace/contract.ts`) - Actions: create/publish listing, add to cart
- [x] **Messages** (`src/apps/messages/contract.ts`) - Actions: send message, mark read, delete thread

### Mock Adapter
- [x] **Mock Adapter** (`src/mocks/adapter.ts`) - Default adapter for demo mode, returns mock data for all actions

### Hooks
- [x] **useCommand** (`src/hooks/useCommand.ts`) - React hook to invoke actions via Command Bus

### Router (Partial)
- [x] **10 Canonical Routes** - Reduced to exactly 10 in `App.tsx`
- [x] **Overlay System** - `?app=` navigation, ESC closes, link interception

## ðŸš§ In Progress / Next Steps

### More Contracts (Day 2)
- [ ] Calendar contract
- [ ] Discover contract  
- [ ] Listings contract
- [ ] Events contract
- [ ] Earnings contract
- [ ] Incentives contract
- [ ] Farm Ops contract
- [ ] Activity contract
- [ ] Favorites contract
- [ ] Analytics contract

### Library & Pinboard (Day 2)
- [ ] `src/library/registry.ts` - Read contracts + lazy UI
- [ ] Library surface (search entities/apps/actions)
- [ ] Pin/unpin to Home or Business Pinboard
- [ ] Pre-pinned set for Producer

### Home Shell (Day 2-3)
- [ ] 3-row CSS grid (header/content/dock)
- [ ] Left pane: Library + Favorites rail
- [ ] Right pane: TikTok feed (For You default), calendar widget
- [ ] Phone: 4-screen pager

### Dashboard (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Left rail modules (Overview, Business, etc.)
- [ ] Next Best Actions widget (mock)
- [ ] Business Pinboard with pre-pins

### Rocker Integration (Day 4)
- [ ] useRocker() hook
- [ ] Suggestions â†’ invoke with one tap
- [ ] Baseline telemetry (overlay_open, tab_changed, reel_view, action_invoked)

### Mocks (Day 1-5, parallel)
- [x] Mock adapter (basic)
- [ ] Full fixtures for feed, shop, events, incentives, earnings
- [ ] Upload stub (accept file, return mock URL)

## How It Works Now

### Command Invocation
```typescript
import { useCommand } from '@/hooks/useCommand';

function MyComponent() {
  const { invoke, loading, result } = useCommand();

  const handleCreateContact = async () => {
    const res = await invoke('crm', 'create_contact', {
      name: 'John Doe',
      phone: '555-1234',
    });
    if (res.success) {
      console.log('Contact created:', res.data);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleCreateContact}>Create Contact</button>;
}
```

### Context Switching
```typescript
import { useContextManager } from '@/kernel/context-manager';

function ContextSwitcher() {
  const { activeType, activeId, setContext } = useContextManager();

  return (
    <select onChange={e => setContext('business', e.target.value)}>
      <option value="">Select Business</option>
      {/* ... */}
    </select>
  );
}
```

### Contract Query
```typescript
import { contractRegistry } from '@/kernel/contract-registry';

// Get all apps that support 'manage_contacts' intent
const crmApps = contractRegistry.findByIntent('manage_contacts');

// Get all apps that work in 'business' context
const businessApps = contractRegistry.findByContext('business');
```

## Definition of Done

### Phase 1 (Kernel) âœ…
- [x] Command Bus validates params and logs actions
- [x] Contracts registered and queryable
- [x] Mock adapter returns data for all actions
- [x] Policy Guard enforces quiet hours/caps (stubs)
- [x] Context Manager tracks active context
- [x] useCommand hook works in React

### Phase 2 (Library & Pinboard) 
- [ ] Search across entities/apps/actions
- [ ] Pin/unpin persists
- [ ] Business Pinboard shows pre-pins

### Phase 3 (Shell & Dashboard)
- [ ] Home shell with 3-row grid
- [ ] Dashboard left rail modules
- [ ] For You is default feed tab
- [ ] Phone pager works

### Phase 4 (Rocker)
- [ ] Suggestions execute via Command Bus
- [ ] Telemetry captures all key events
- [ ] AI Activity shows ledger

## Architectural Wins

1. **Stable API**: Apps declare contracts; UI can change without breaking Rocker
2. **Mock-first**: All flows testable without backend
3. **Overlay-first**: Zero page nav; everything in-place
4. **Context-aware**: Feed/actions rebind on context switch
5. **Permission-aware**: Actions check ownership/role via Policy Guard
6. **Idempotent**: Command Bus caches results by key
7. **Telemetry**: Every action emits events for Rocker AI

## Next Session Priorities

1. Add contracts for remaining apps (calendar, discover, events, listings, etc.)
2. Build Library surface with search
3. Implement Pinboard (Home + Business)
4. Complete Home shell (3-row grid, favorites rail, feed tabs)
5. Wire Rocker suggestions â†’ Command Bus invoke

**Status**: Kernel is live. Apps can invoke actions via contracts. Ready to build Library & shell.
