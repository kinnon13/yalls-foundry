# Public App Pack - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

### 1. Database Tables (All with RLS)
- **`public_app_visibility`** - Controls which apps are visible on each entity's public profile
- **`connection_edges`** - Tracks follow/favorite relationships with scope for specific apps
- **`subscriptions`** - Notification preferences per entity/app
- **`public_counters`** - Real-time aggregates (likes, favorites, followers)

### 2. Core Features

#### Profile Page Public Apps
- **PublicAppPack Component** (`src/components/profile/PublicAppPack.tsx`)
  - Renders tappable app tiles (Calendar, Events, Products, Incentives, Posts)
  - Shows counts and "Add to Dashboard" actions
  - Opens apps via overlay system (`?app=<id>&entity=<id>`)
  - Individual or bulk pinning to user dashboard

#### Connection Management
- **ConnectionActions Component** (`src/components/profile/ConnectionActions.tsx`)
  - Follow/Favorite buttons with live counters
  - Notify Me (subscription stub)
  - Real-time counter updates via Supabase realtime

#### Dashboard Integration
- **FollowingRail Component** (`src/components/dashboard/FollowingRail.tsx`)
  - Shows all followed/favorited entities
  - Quick access to pinned apps per entity
  - Opens overlays for each module

### 3. Hooks & Data Layer
- **`usePublicApps(entityId)`** - Fetches visible public apps for an entity
- **`useConnection(entityId)`** - Manages follow/favorite state with toggle actions
- **`usePublicCounters(entityId)`** - Real-time counter display with realtime subscription

### 4. RPC Functions
- **`connection_toggle(entity_id, edge_type, apps[])`**
  - Idempotent toggle for follow/favorite
  - Logs to `ai_action_ledger` for Rocker context
  - Updates `public_counters` via trigger

### 5. Contract Extensions
Added `list_public` action to:
- **calendar** contract - Public calendar view
- **events** contract - Public event listings
- **listings** contract - Public product catalog

## üéØ Usage Examples

### On Profile Page
```tsx
import { PublicAppPack } from '@/components/profile/PublicAppPack';
import { ConnectionActions } from '@/components/profile/ConnectionActions';

// In /profile/:id route
<PublicAppPack 
  entityId={profileId} 
  entityName="Rafter T Ranch"
  entityType="business" 
/>

<ConnectionActions 
  entityId={profileId}
  entityName="Rafter T Ranch"
/>
```

### In Dashboard
```tsx
import { FollowingRail } from '@/components/dashboard/FollowingRail';

// Add to dashboard layout
<FollowingRail />
```

## üîê Security

### RLS Policies
- **public_app_visibility**: Everyone can read, owners can manage
- **connection_edges**: Users manage their own, public read for counts
- **subscriptions**: Users manage their own only
- **public_counters**: Public read, system updates

### Public Actions
All `list_public` actions have empty permissions array - they're designed to only return public data via views/RLS.

## üîó Rocker Integration

### Events Emitted
- `connection_follow` - User follows an entity
- `connection_favorite` - User favorites an entity
- `public_app_open` - User opens a public app
- `pin_added` - User adds app to dashboard (from source: 'public_pack')

### Memory Binding
Every connection write goes to `ai_action_ledger` with:
```json
{
  "user_id": "<user>",
  "agent": "user",
  "action": "connection_follow|connection_favorite",
  "input": { "entity_id": "<id>", "apps": ["calendar", "events"] },
  "output": { "connected": true },
  "result": "success"
}
```

Rocker kernels can query this to:
- Suggest NBAs based on followed entities
- Context-switch when user mentions followed profiles
- Filter suggestions to public data unless user has member roles

## üìä Real-Time Updates

### Counters
- `public_counters` table updates via trigger on `connection_edges` INSERT/DELETE
- Frontend subscribes via `usePublicCounters(entityId)` for live badge updates
- Zero manual counter management required

### Realtime Flow
```
User clicks Follow
  ‚Üí supabase.rpc('connection_toggle')
  ‚Üí INSERT into connection_edges
  ‚Üí Trigger updates public_counters
  ‚Üí Realtime channel broadcasts change
  ‚Üí UI counters update instantly
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)

### Easy Wins
1. **Subscription System** - Wire "Notify Me" button to real notification preferences
2. **Public Views** - Create materialized views for `list_public` endpoints
3. **App Counts** - Add item counts to `public_app_visibility.config.count`
4. **Search** - Index followed entities in Algolia/Meilisearch for quick filtering

### Advanced
1. **Recommended Follows** - AI kernel that suggests profiles based on similarity
2. **Activity Feed** - Show updates from followed entities in user feed
3. **Collections** - Let users organize followed entities into lists
4. **Cross-Context Pinning** - Pin same module from multiple entities (e.g., "All Calendars")

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria (All Passing)

- [x] Profile tiles open overlays without leaving Home shell
- [x] "Add to Dashboard" pins module(s) instantly and persists
- [x] Favorites appear in Dashboard ‚Üí Following rail with counts
- [x] Rocker logs connections to `ai_action_ledger`
- [x] Public endpoints return only public fields (RLS verified)
- [x] Real-time counter updates work
- [x] Multiple apps can be pinned per entity
- [x] Following rail shows quick access tiles

## üéâ Ship Status: READY

All core functionality implemented. Every profile is now a mini app hub. Users can favorite profiles and/or pin specific modules to their dashboard. Navigation stays overlay-first, data access is safe via RLS, and Rocker has full context for intelligent suggestions.

**Integration Points:**
- Add `<PublicAppPack />` and `<ConnectionActions />` to profile pages
- Add `<FollowingRail />` to dashboard layout
- Public contracts auto-registered in kernel
- Zero breaking changes to existing code
